# Semi Intelligent BOT
## The project involves :  
1. Classifying fake news  
2. Classifying objects such as aeroplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck  
3. Chatbot to run some errands, for instance, greeting, asking questions, etc  
  
According to [CRISP-DM methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining), the project was separated into three main steps

- step 1 preprocess data, for example, tokenize words for a chatbot or standard scale for objects classify model  
- step 2 is to make a model   
in this project, I used 15 varieties of machine learning algorithms and also deep learning  
- step 3 deployment, I'd rather deploy on telegram  
> Telegram is the best social media app I've ever seen in my life.
